            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The narrow Virtues of the Old Philoſophers, were rather Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if winnow'd well, form'd to gratify their Proud, Lazy, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority, at the Expence of all the Publick Duties incumbent on mankind, whom they pretend to Purge from his Paſſions, to make him happy, by that means to amuſe our Curioſity with Chyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's, whilſt we loſt our real Good, will ſtill naturally flow from thoſe Springs of Pleaſure, Honour, Glory, and Noble Actions, the Paſſions given us by Heaven for our common Good. But their own Practice generally ſhew'd the Vanity of their Emperic Boaſts, when they Buried all the Nobler Pleaſures of the Mind in Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, and Pedantick Pride, as <hi>Lucian</hi> has pleaſantly made out in <hi>Hermotimus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe Notional Excellencies that divert us from, or weaken a Publick Spirit, are always Falſe and Hypocritical, that under a gaudy out-ſide, conceals a rotten Carcaſs, full of Infectious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers that deſtroy the nobleſt end of our Being, <hi>The doing good to one another.</hi> Vanity has always been the Refuge of little Souls, that place their Value in a falſe Greatneſs, Hyppocriſie and great Titles What a ſeeming Holineſs does for the Avaritious, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning Saint; Titles do for the proud Avarice of the meer Man of Quality, cheaply Purchaſing a Reſpect from the many; but 'tis the Generous man only that ſixes himſelf in the Hearts of the moſt valuable part of mankind, where proper Merit only is eſteem'd, and the Man, not his Equipage, and Accidental Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances reſpected.</p>
            <p>The Application of this, I ſhall leave to all that know you, Sir, who are all ſenſible what Virtues you make your Darlings, and choice of Virtue ſhews the Nobleneſs of our Temper, as much as Choice of Friends, the degrees of our Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and if that be true that moſt men chooſe thoſe Virtues which are neareſt a-kin to their Darling Vices, I'm ſure 'twill be a ſtrong proof, that ev'n your Failings (for ev'ry Man has his ſhare of them too) are more Beneficial to the world, than the Vertues of a numerous part of Mankind.

This it was that encourag'd me to dedicate this Play, Sir, to you, of which I may venture to ſay more, and with more aſſurance, than if it had been my own.</p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>BEHN</hi> was a Woman ſo Accompliſh'd, and of ſo Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd a Fame among the Men of Senſe, that I cou'd not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a very ſevere treatment from the Town, which has been very indulgent to the Performances of others, eſpecially when, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Reputation of the <hi>Author,</hi> the Play it ſelf had an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſic Merit; for we find it full of Humour, Wit, and Variety; the Converſation Gay and Genteel, the Love, Soft and Pathetic, the incidents Natural, and Eaſy, and the Conduct of the Plot very Juſtifiable. So that I may reaſonably impute its miſcarriage to ſome Faction that was made againſt it, which indeed was very Evident on the Firſt day, and more on the endeavours em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, to render the Profits of the Third, as ſmall as could be.</p>
            <p>It ſuffer'd not, I'm ſure, in the Action, nor in Mr. <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruggen's</hi> reading of ſome of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There might indeed be ſome objections about the Plot, but not very Rational, I think; I'm ſure, at leaſt, 'tis the firſt Play, for ſome Years, could be quarrell'd at for having too much Plot. In the Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on however, I have put in a great deal, which the length of the Play oblig'd me to cut out for the Action.</p>

            <p>Here, Sir, if the Play had been my own, I ſhould have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd that the Town had its favourite Fools, as well as favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite Wits, and that Comedy or Farce from any other hand, wou'd no more go down with them, than their favourites will with true Judges that read, not ſee'em. I ſhould have had indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on enough, perhaps, to've rail'd at the Criticks of all Degrees, and Denominations of Box and Pit, nay, Galleries too, and told 'em that they were ſo conceited of their own Wit, that they cou'd take no pleaſure in hearing that of another, or that Wit in a Play ſeeming to affront the Parts of the Audience, they ſuffer'd their Reſentment to deſtroy their Satisfaction. This, and a great many other Satyrical Reflections, which are Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for a Diſappointed Poet to make, I ſhou'd then have vented; but being ſatisfy'd, that the Reputation of Mrs. <hi>BEHN</hi> is not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the malicious Endeavours of ſome of my Enemies, I now preſent it under your Patronage, Sir, to the more competent Judges; Proud of the Opportunity of Offering you an occaſion of ſo agreeable a Province, as the Protection of the unfortunate, and letting the World know how much I am, Sir,</p>

            <p>MRS. <hi>Behn,</hi> was a woman of ſo Celebrated a fame while ſhe liv'd, and ſo eſteem'd by all that have read any thing of her writing ſince her Death, that I ſuppoſe a ſhort Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her Life will be a very grateful preſent to the Ingenious. To give a perfect draught of her is a task of more weight than my preſent Time, and Affairs will allow, or indeed my Abilities, for to draw her to the Life, one muſt write like her, that is with all the ſoftneſs of her Sex, and all the fire of ours. But an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent sketch of ſo Admirable a Woman, will be welcome where no better is to be had, and that value which the Artiſt cannot give, it will gain from the Original.</p>
            <p>Her Maiden Name was <hi>Johnſon,</hi> her father was a Gentleman of a good Family in <hi>Canterbury</hi> in <hi>Kent.</hi> Her Childhood ſhe paſs'd in that City, but not without the promiſes of the extraordinary Excellencies of her Riper years, both in Wit and Beauty; ſhe had always agreat Inclination for Poetry, and was truly born a Poet, not made nor form'd by Induſtry. I muſt not be particular in all the little Accidents of her Child-hood, for that wou'd be more than my Reader would Pardon, tho moſt Writers of Lives take care to omit not the leaſt trivial Actions of the very infancy of the Perſons they wou'd Celebrate, and indeed make them often more conſiderable, than any of their Life. But one motive to that Impertinence I want, <hi>Prolixity;</hi> for I aim at as ſhort a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as poſſible.

How grateful he was, or whether her ſervice made his ſatisfaction ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to a reward, I have forgot. But to that ſoft Court we owe her exerting her Poetical Genius, which for many years gave the ſenſible part of the Town ſo many agreeable Diverſions. She was of a generous, and open temper, an eaſy and free Converſation, with abundance of Wit and nice Reaſoning above moſt, if not all that I have ever obſerv'd in that Sex, which tho often happy in a brisk Wit, and pleaſant Repartee, yet are, for want of Education, Study and Application of Mind, generally to ſeek in the nicer Obſervations, and Reflections of Judgment. The finer ſort of Reaſoning is moſt commonly out of their way, and indeed not ſo agreeable as a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel railery, and at moſt a ſuperficial Argumentation, built on the firſt Appearances of things, which are too often a very falſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful Foundation. But Mrs. <hi>Behn,</hi> in the niceſt Metaphyſical points, would Argue with judgment, and extreamly happy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions; ſhe would, with an engaging Air, enforce her Notions, with all the Juſtneſs of the moſt able Philoſopher, tho not with his Majeſtical Roughneſs; which made all ſhe ſaid more prevalent with her Hearers. But this is not half her true Praiſe, for her Converſation was general, and never impertinent; her Vanity gave no Alloy to her Wit, and was no more than might juſtly Spring from Conſcious Virtue; ſhe never inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated her Merit by any other means, than the Fine Things ſhe ſpoke, which oblig'd others to praiſe her ſo much, that ſhe could not put her Friends to the Bluſh to praiſe her ſelf, tho that is a Vanity much more agreeable in a Lady, than in a Man; in the firſt, it ſaves a Man the Expence of Flatter, whilſt he may cheaply do't by ſaying, <hi>Amen,</hi> to what the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy advances of her own; but in the latter 'tis intolerable, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe of either Pleaſure or Profit.</p>
            <p>To give the Reader a view of Her, or her Works, as they both require, would ſwell into a Volume, and provoke too much the Envy of the reſt of her Sex, who, whilſt the Firſt
<pb facs="tcp:59382:6"/> Place every thing is not given to her may loſe their Malice and Envy in a generous Emulation of out-doing her in ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence or other.</p>
            <p>After what I have ſaid of Mrs. <hi>Behn,</hi> 'twill be concluded, that ſhe was too great a favourite of Nature, to have many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to fortune; at leaſt the latter part of her Life found her Circumſtances much below her Deſert; and after a tedious Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſeveral years foregoing Indiſpoſition, ſhe dy'd ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Revolution, and lies now Bury'd in the <hi>Cloyſters</hi> of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Abby,</hi> under a plain Marble Stone, with two Wretched Verſes for her Epitaph, who had her ſelf Wrote ſo many good.</p>
            <p>Her Muſe was never ſubject to the Curſe of bringing forth with Pain; for ſhe always Writ with the greateſt caſe in the world, and that in the midſt of Company, and Diſcourſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters. I ſaw her my ſelf write <hi>Oroonoko,</hi> and keep her turn in Diſcourſing with ſeveral then preſent in the Room. Among ſeveral Pieces that I ſaw of hers, in her own hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing, this following Play was one; which, ſpight of the malice of ſome, and folly of others, <hi>who are dully vain of being hard to pleaſe,</hi> as my Lord <hi>Rocheſter</hi> ſays, has intrinſick value enough to recommend it ſelf to the VVorld, and condemn the Brutal Treatment it met with the firſt day.</p>
